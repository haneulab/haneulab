## About Me

My name is **Haneul Choi**. I am originally from Korea and currently based in Davis, California.

I began my learning in software development since 2020, where I first started with basic web programming with technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

In my school, taking computer science courses helped me learn how to implement **object-oriented programming** in **python** language. Also, learning about linux command line interfaces and how to interact with operating system with it was definitely one of the fun learning experiences I got to have.

I do not like Copy and Paste. I believe that I got to have more fun in software development and programming in general when I actually practiced what I learned from online and classes when I want to implement my interesting ideas as my side projects.

## Software Development

There are some categories of software development that I have been working or am working in at this time.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Web Development

#### About My Web Development

I have nothing to say about software development without mentioning my web development journey. I started with web development, _ex. building a simple `index.html` page_, to deploying intermediate web applicaitons using more advanced technologies like **React** and **NextJs**.

**My Web Tech Stacks**

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org)
- [NextJS](https://reactjs.org)
- [TypeScript](https://reactjs.org)
- [TailwindCSS](https://reactjs.org)
- [Firebase](https://reactjs.org)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Software Package Development

As I develop in **Node** environment using frameworks like **React** and **NextJS**, I happen to take a short youtube video about building _my own npm library_.

Also I happen to program a lot in **Python** for school projects where I use many built-in and installable packages.

These experiences help me realize the importance of keeping in mind that there are better (or more efficient) ways to implement the project I want by creating these packages for my own (or even for others) use. **Especially**, the repetetive actions like setting up the environment or using reusable functions and components in my projects can be available via packages instead of me having to create everytime I work on a new project. I call this **Availability and Efficiency By Resuability**.

As I develop more complicated projects as I learn more about software development, I always keep in mind of increasing efficiency by decreasing repetitions.

**My Software Packages**

_Currently there is no package that I am able to show in public_. I will create one for demonstration in near future and update it here.

### ‚öôÔ∏è General Program Development

In my college courses, I've had change to learn different programming languages including **C** and **Python**.

I can say that I use **Python** a lot more than **C** for my personal programming and program development.

Whenever I want to focus on learning or improving my programming styles and knowledge, I try to create simple to intermediate-level programs like CLI-based programs or browser-based programs.

**My General Program Projects**

_Currently there is no project that I am able to show in public_. I will create one for demonstration in near future and update it here.
